## Introduction

Desk provides a Docker powered experience for Laravel that is compatible with macOS, Windows (WSL2), and Linux. Other than Docker, no software or libraries are required to be installed on your local computer before using Sail. Sail's simple CLI means you can start building your Laravel application without any previous Docker experience.

#### Inspiration

Desk is forked from Laravel Sail and derived from [Vessel](https://github.com/shipping-docker/vessel) by [Chris Fidao](https://github.com/fideloper). If you're looking for a thorough introduction to Docker, check out Chris' course: [Shipping Docker](https://serversforhackers.com/shipping-docker).

## Official Documentation for Laravel Sail

Documentation for Laravel Sail can be found on the [Laravel website](https://laravel.com/docs/sail).

## License

Desk is open-sourced software licensed under the [MIT license](LICENSE.md).
